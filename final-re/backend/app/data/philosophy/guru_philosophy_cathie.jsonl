As a result, we believe many, if not most, investors have under allocated to bitcoin in multi-asset portfolios.

Designed to measure the unit of reward per unit of risk, the Sharpe Ratio is constructed as follows: Interestingly, the Sharpe Ratio equates risk to an asset’s total realized volatility over time. While somewhat controversial, that notion is widely applied in financial analysis. How does the Sharpe Ratio measure bitcoin’s risk relative to its reward?

Several years ago, MicroStrategy pioneered the bitcoin DAT model, but investors did not understand how to apply it to other digital assets.

While it began by issuing convertible senior notes, followed by senior secured notes at a 6.125% yield, the real breakthrough was an at-the-market (ATM) equity program. Because its stock, MSTR, was trading at a substantial premium to book value, Saylor issued new shares, diluting existing holders but using the proceeds to buy more bitcoin and increase its bitcoin per share.

Except for a brief dip into discount territory during the bear market between March 2022 and January 2024, MSTR has been priced at a significant premium to mNAV.

Risks While DATs offer new ways to gain exposure to cryptoassets, they also introduce significant risks that investors must weigh carefully. The first is dependence on market premiums. The DAT model—particularly the growth in crypto per share— relies on stocks trading at a premium to mNAV. When the premium compresses, a DAT’s ability to issue accretive equity diminishes and can disappear, forcing them to slow purchases or to liquidate tokens and repurchase shares. Second, liquidity can cut both ways.

{"page_content": "Cathie HAS INFLATION DERAILED DISRUPTIVE INNOVATION? Since mid-February 2021, many broad-based market indexes have scaled to record highs and, in the process, rotated away from growth stocks toward “value” and defensive stocks, including the FAANGs. Chief among the reasons for this rotation are fears that inflation is not a short-term problem related to supply chain bottlenecks, but the result of excessive monetary and fiscal policy responses to the coronavirus and its variants. Associated with strong economic cycles, inflation tends to benefit “value stocks,” particularly energy, financial services, industrials, and materials. At the same time, by raising discount rates and lowering the present value of future cash flows, higher interest rates tend to hurt long duration assets like aggressive growth stocks.", "metadata": {"guru_id": "cathie", "doc_type": "philosophy", "source": "report_or_interview", "title": "Cathie Wood Data", "page": 956, "chunk_index": 0}}
{"page_content": "Typically, the companies underlying those stocks are sacrificing short term profitability and investing aggressively to capitalize on substantial growth opportunities. In November 2021, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell suggested that inflation might not be “transitory” after all, turbocharging the rotation toward value stocks and giving investors more reason for tax loss selling in the innovation space as the year winds down. ARE QUANT STRATEGIES AND ALGORITHMS EXACERBATING INFLATION FEARS? As was the case during the depths of the coronavirus last year, quant and algorithm- based strategies seemed to dominate stock market activity during the first three months of the rotation earlier this year and then again recently. By some , algorithmic trading accounts for roughly 70% of all trading in the US, and even higher percentages during periods of heightened volatility.", "metadata": {"guru_id": "cathie", "doc_type": "philosophy", "source": "report_or_interview", "title": "Cathie Wood Data", "page": 956, "chunk_index": 1}}
{"page_content": "Last year, as the equity market responded to the ugly reality of the coronavirus during March and April, quant and algorithmically driven strategies seemed to seize simplistically on two variables – level of cash on company balance sheets and rate of cash burn – and, in just a few weeks, they crushed many stocks by 50-75%. Momentum followers and market commentators embraced this “obvious” trade, but they were wrong. Many of those stocks were in the genomic space, their underlying technologies critical to tackling the coronavirus: genomic sequencing, synthetic biology, mRNA technology, machine learning, and molecular diagnostic testing, among others. Against conventional wisdom, buying those stocks was the right move. At times this year, as inflation and interest rates flared, quants and algorithms again seemed to dominate trading activity.", "metadata": {"guru_id": "cathie", "doc_type": "philosophy", "source": "report_or_interview", "title": "Cathie Wood Data", "page": 956, "chunk_index": 2}}
